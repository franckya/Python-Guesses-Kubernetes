To deploy a Python application that guesses numbers on Kubernetes, you will need to create a container image for your application and then use a Kubernetes deployment to manage the running instances of the container.

Here is an example of a Kubernetes deployment configuration file for a Python application that guesses numbers:

``
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: number-guesser
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: number-guesser
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: number-guesser
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: number-guesser
        image: myregistry/number-guesser:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        ``

This deployment configuration will create two replicas of the number-guesser container, each running the latest version of the myregistry/number-guesser image. The container will listen on port 8080.

To create the container image for your application, you will need to package your Python code and any dependencies into a Docker image. You can then push the image to a container registry, such as Docker Hub or Google Container Registry, and reference it in the deployment configuration file.

Here is an example of a Dockerfile that you can use to build a container image for a Python application that guesses numbers:
``
FROM python:3.8

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["python", "guesser.py"] ``


This Dockerfile will start from the official Python 3.8 image, copy the files from the current directory into the /app directory in the container, install the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file, and expose port 8080. The CMD command specifies the command to run when the container starts.

To build and push the container image, you can use the following commands:

# Build the container image
``docker build -t myregistry/number-guesser:latest .``

# Push the container image to the registry
``docker push myregistry/number-guesser:latest``

Once you have created the container image and deployment configuration, you can use the kubectl command-line tool to deploy your application to Kubernetes.

# Apply the deployment configuration to the cluster
``kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml``

This will create the necessary resources in the cluster to run your application. You can use the kubectl command to check the status of the deployment and the containers running in the cluster.

# Check the status of the deployment
``kubectl get deployment number-guesser``

# Check the status of the containers
``kubectl get pods``

You may also want to create a Kubernetes service to expose your application to the external network. You can do this by creating a service configuration file and applying it to the cluster with the kubectl command.

Here is an example service configuration file that exposes the number-guesser deployment on a NodePort:
``
apiVersion: v1
kind
``
